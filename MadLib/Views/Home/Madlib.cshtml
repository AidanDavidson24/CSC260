<h1 class="text-center">Summer Trip</h1>

<div class="madlib">
    Over the summer we got to go to the <b>@ViewBag.adj1</b> park known as Disneyland, we got to on every ride. Even <b>@ViewBag.n2</b> which is always a/an <b>@ViewBag.adj3</b> one. Then there was <b>@ViewBag.n4</b> which was also a <b>@ViewBag.av5</b> ride.
    Then there was the <b>@ViewBag.v6</b> ride that almost made us puke. After that we found these<b>@ViewBag.sw7</b> cups that we got and carried around. Eventually we found a <b>@ViewBag.adj8</b>place to sit down. <b>@ViewBag.n9</b> was a amazing ride as well. My best friend <b>@ViewBag.fn10</b> was very <b>@ViewBag.adj11</b> after <b>@ViewBag.num12</b> o clock on our first day. 
    The first day was crazy but really fun. The rides we liked the most were <b>@ViewBag.fn13</b>, <b>@ViewBag.fn14</b>, <b>@ViewBag.fn15</b>, <b>@ViewBag.fn16</b>, <b>@ViewBag.fn17</b>, <b>@ViewBag.fn18</b>.
    We also got to meet<b>@ViewBag.n19</b> it was funny. <br>
